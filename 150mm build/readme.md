<br><i> All parts use M3 hardware & standard heatsets. </i>
<br><h3>
The only difference between the voron builds are the skirt sizes, sadly, i could not find skirts for 150mm builds anywhere online so i made my own. 
These skirts where designed for 2020 I-type extrusions with 5mm width, this means they will work on pretty much any 2020 extrusion, however, there might be alignment issues as the indexing parts are 5mm wide instead of 6mm.
<br>

Note that these are not official skirts and are heavily inspired by the stock skirts designed by RFC. 
Note that these skirts do NOT host a mount for any display, the files may be edited so such can be used. 
<br>

The front skirt hosts a single 6020 fan. All panels sizes are the same as the voron 2.4 configurator suggets for 150mm^3 size.

<br><i> Because the brackets for the electronics are mounted in the 2020 extrusions, you may "slide" the electronics into desired position. </i>

<br><i> There's close to 40mm clearence from the octopus holder to the bottom panel, should be more than enough space. All panels are 3mm thick. </i>
