The only difference between the voron builds are the skirt sizes, sadly, i could not find skirts for 150mm builds anywhere online so i made my own. 
These skirts where designed for 2020 I-type extrusions with 5mm width, this means they will work on pretty much any 2020 extrusion, however, there might be alignment issues as the indexing parts are 5mm wide instead of 6mm.<br>

Note that these are not official skirts and are heavily inspired by the stock skirts designed by RFC. 
Note that these skirts do NOT host a mount for any display, the files may be edited so such can be used. <br>

The front skirt hosts a single 6020 fan, and the skirts are intended to be used with a 290x290mm bottom panel. <br><br>

<del><B> TODO: Add mount for octopus + rpi zero 2w </B></del><br><br>
<B> Bugfixes: Right & Left skirt had a part that would print mid air, added a slope so that should no longer be an issue. 2021-12-29 </B> <br><br>
<B> Updates: Added extrusion placeholder, added mounts for PSU (uhp350-24). Also added mounting points on the skirts. Added accent color voron logo for each side. 2022-01-25</B> <br> <B> Added Mounts for 6020/6025, mount for 350uhp, octopus & rpi zero 2w (see pic, green items are brackets that slot into 2020, m3 hardware). 2022-01-30 <B> <br><br>
